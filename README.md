### 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
This project is about creating a simple interpreter for Monty ByteCodes. The interpreter reads a bytecode file and executes the bytecode commands.

The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes, similar to Python. It utilizes a unique stack with specific instructions to manipulate it.

Monty byte code files
Files containing Monty byte codes typically have the .m extension. While most of the industry follows this standard, it is not mandatory according to the language specification. Each line in the file contains only one instruction. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument.

Objectives
The objectives of this project are as follows:

Understand the meaning of LIFO and FIFO
Understand the concept of a stack and when to use it
Understand the concept of a queue and when to use it
Familiarize with the common implementations of stacks and queues
Learn about the most common use cases of stacks and queues
Understand the proper way to use global variables
Resources
Difference between Stack and Queue Data Structures
General Requirements

All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, -pedantic, and -std=gnu89
All files end with a new line
There is a README.md file at the root of the alx-low_level_programming directory
Maximum of one global variable is allowed
No more than 5 functions per file
The C standard library is allowed
The prototypes of all the functions are included in the header file called monty.h
